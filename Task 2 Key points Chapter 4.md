# Key Points on Training Data

## Introduction
<p align="justify">
In this task, some important points are discussed among the different sections of chapter 4. Priority is given to ideas that bring together a general approach to how to deal with training data, which for each case has its peculiarities and must be carefully analyzed when developing a training model in machine learning. Training data forms the base of machine learning (ML) systems, dictating the performance and reliability of the models. In Chapter 4 of Chip Huyen's book, "Designing Machine Learning Systems," various aspects of training data handling are discussed, explaining the significance of sampling methods, label acquisition, class imbalance management, and evaluation metrics in ensuring the efficacy of ML models.
